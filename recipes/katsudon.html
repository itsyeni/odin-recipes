        <h1>Katsudon (Pork Cutlet Rice Bowl)</h1>
        <img src="../images/Katsudon.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Katsudon is a Japanese pork cutlet rice bowl made with Tonkatsu, eggs, and sauteed onions simmered in a sweet and savory sauce. The word “katsudon” is a portmanteau, or a blending of two separate Japanese words. “Katsu” comes from “tonkatsu,” or breaded, fried cutlet, and “don (丼)” comes from “donburi” (丼ぶり), which translates to “large bowl.” </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 center-cut boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi stock or chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Mirin</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 medium thinly sliced onion</li>
            <li>2 servings steamed white rice</li>
            <li>1 chopped scallion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper, and dust with a light, even coating of flour.In one shallow bowl, beat the egg. Put the panko into another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Add a thin, even layer of oil to a cast iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you throw a panko breadcrumb into the oil and it sizzles.</li>
            <li>Dip the pork into the egg to coat. Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat to get a good coating.</li>
            <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5-6 minutes on one side, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side for another 5-6 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>While the pork is resting, add the dashi stock (or chicken stock), sugar, soy sauce, and mirin to a small bowl. In another bowl, lightly beat 2 eggs. Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan over medium heat, and add the sliced onion. Fry the onions until they’re translucent and slightly caramelized.</li>
            <li>Pour the stock mixture over the onions. Slice your tonkatsu into pieces and place on top of the onions.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the egg over everything.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium low heat until the egg is just set. Serve over bowls of steamed rice, and garnish with scallions.</li>
        </ol>
