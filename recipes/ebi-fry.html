        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ebi Fry is a Japanese fried shrimp dish made with succulent shrimp coated with Panko breadcrumbs and fried till golden brown. It is one of the most popular Yoshoku (western style) dishes and a frequent menu item for the Okosama Set (Childrenâ€™s Meal) at family restaurants. It is often served with tartar sauce or tonkatsu sauce. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the shrimp:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 large shrimp, deveined, tails on</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg, gently beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the tartar sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg, boiled, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely minced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely minced pickles</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Dash kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>Dash freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely shredded green cabbage, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean shrimp: remove shells from shrimp without removing tails. (If shrimp have not been deveined, simply cut a slit on the back of the shrimp to remove black innards, using a toothpick to lift vein out.)</li>
            <li>Make a few incisions on stomach side of shrimp and lightly press back of shrimp to straighten it out. This will prevent shrimp from curling when cooked.</li>
            <li>Pat shrimp dry using paper towels.</li>
            <li>Set up a work station with 3 shallow dishes: place flour in the first, beaten egg in the second, and panko breadcrumbs in the last dish. Be sure to add a touch of salt and black pepper to the flour, which helps to add flavor to the ebi fry.</li>
            <li>First, dust shrimp in flour lightly.</li>
            <li>Then, dip flour coated shrimp in egg wash.</li>
            <li>Finally, place shrimp in panko and make sure that shrimp is coated completely with panko breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>In a deep pan, heat oil to about 340 F o 360 F. Set up large plate or platter covered with paper towels to drain shrimp after it's been fried.</li>
            <li>Fry breaded shrimp until brown, turning over once, before moving shrimp to paper towel-covered plate to drain.</li>
            <li>To make tartar sauce, mix finely chopped boiled egg, minced onion and pickles, and mayonnaise all together in a small bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place ebi fry on a plate along with some tartar sauce on the side (or bottled tonkatsu sauce) and finely shredded cabbage. Serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
